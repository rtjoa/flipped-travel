# Flipped Travel

A DubHacks 2020 project by Hao, Ryan, Chi, Shoaib, and Gary.

The frontend, built with React and the Google Maps JavaScript API, allows the user to explore points of interest, as well as annotate the map with text and images for other users. The backend, which manages these annotations, was built with Node, Express, and MongoDB.

Use `npm install` and `npm start` in `api/` to run the frontend, then in `app/` to run the backend.
